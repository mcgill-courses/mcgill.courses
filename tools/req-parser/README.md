**req-parser** is a tool to generate JSON-based course graph structures for
course entries used within the application.

We fine-tune a large language model on labeled examples to achieve high
accuracy with our output.

### Setup

First, install dependencies and run a shell:

```bash
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Refer to `.env.example` for what environment variables need to be set.

### Usage

It's a single python script you can run, passing in a file on disk:

```bash
python3 main.py ../../seed/courses-2024-2025.json
```

It will run and populate a few fields on pre-existing course entries with the
generated graph structure.

For full usage information, see the output below:

```
usage: main.py [-h] [-d DELAY] [-o] file

Parse logical course requirements from existing data.

positional arguments:
  file                  The path to the course JSON file.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        The delay between requests in milliseconds.
  -o, --overwrite       Reparse all courses, even if they already have parsed requirements.
```
