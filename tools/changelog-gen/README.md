### changelog-gen

**changelog-gen** is a tool that outputs monthly-scoped AI generated summaries for
pull requests present in a GitHub repository.

This tool runs automatically in our [CI pipeline](https://github.com/terror/mcgill.courses/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yaml)
to generate new entries for merged PRs.
