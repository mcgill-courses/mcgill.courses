### Development

You'll need [docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed
on your machine to spawn the various components the project needs to run
locally.

First, join the discord server to get access to the development environment
variables:

https://discord.gg/edfravxD

In `.env` within the root directory you'll have to set

```
MS_CLIENT_ID=
MS_CLIENT_SECRET=
MS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/authorized
```

...and then in `client/.env` you'll have to set the server url

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Second, mount a local [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance with docker
and initiate the replica set:

```bash
docker compose up --no-recreate -d
sleep 5
docker exec mongodb mongosh --quiet --eval 'rs.initiate()' > /dev/null 2>&1 || true
```

Spawn the server with a data source (in this case the `/seed` directory) and
initialize the database (note that seeding may take some time on slower machines):

```bash
cargo run -- --source=seed serve --initialize --db-name=mcgill-courses
```

Finally, spawn the react frontend:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

_n.b._ If you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, we provide a
`dev` recipe for doing all of the above in addition to running a watch on the
server:

```bash
just dev
```

See the
[justfile](https://github.com/terror/mcgill.courses/blob/master/justfile) for
more recipes.

### Gathering seed data

The server command-line interface provides a load subcommand for scraping all
courses from various McGill course information websites and building a JSON data
source, for example:

```
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -- --source=seed \
  load \
  --batch-size=200 \
  --scrape-vsb \
  --user-agent "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/111.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
```

The current defaults include scraping all current 10,000+ courses offered by
McGill, current schedule information from the official
[visual schedule builder](https://vsb.mcgill.ca), and courses offered in
previous terms going back as far the 2009-2010 term.

For full usage information, see the output below:

```present just run load --help
Usage: server load [OPTIONS] --user-agent <USER_AGENT>

Options:
      --user-agent <USER_AGENT>      A user agent
      --course-delay <COURSE_DELAY>  Time delay between course requests in milliseconds [default: 0]
      --page-delay <PAGE_DELAY>      Time delay between page requests in milliseconds [default: 0]
      --retries <RETRIES>            Number of retries [default: 10]
      --batch-size <BATCH_SIZE>      Number of pages to scrape per concurrent batch [default: 20]
      --mcgill-terms <MCGILL_TERMS>  The mcgill terms to scrape [default: 2009-2010 2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 2015-2016 2016-2017 2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 2022-2023 2023-2024]
      --vsb-terms <VSB_TERMS>        The schedule builder terms to scrape [default: 202305 202309 202401]
      --scrape-vsb                   Scrape visual schedule builder information
  -h, --help                         Print help
```

Alternatively, if you have [just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed, you
can run:

```
just load
```

We parse prerequisites and corequisites using
[llama-index](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) with custom examples, all the code
lives in
[`/tools/req-parser`](https://github.com/terror/mcgill.courses/tree/master/tools/req-parser).

If you need to run the requirement parser on a file, simply:

```bash
cd tools/req-parser
poetry install
poetry shell
python3 main.py <file>
```

_n.b._ This will require an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) API key to be set in
the environment.

### Prior Art

There are a few notable projects worth mentioning that are similar in nature to
[mcgill.courses](https://mcgill.courses), and have either led to inspiration or
new ideas with regard to its functionality and design, namely:

- [uwflow.com](https://uwflow.com/) - A course search and review platform for
  the University of Waterloo
- [cloudberry.fyi](https://www.cloudberry.fyi/) - A post-modern schedule builder
  for McGill students
- [mcgill.wtf](https://mcgill.wtf/) - A fast full-text search engine for McGill
  courses
